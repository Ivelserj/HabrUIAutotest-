# Cursor Rules for SVG Mockup Generation and UI/UX Design

## SVG File Creation Rules

### XML/SVG Encoding and Comments
- **ALWAYS** use only ASCII characters (0x00-0x7F) in XML comments
- **NEVER** use non-ASCII characters (Cyrillic, special symbols, emoji) in XML comments
- Use English language for all XML/SVG comments
- Format: `<!-- English comment text -->`
- Validate XML syntax before saving files

### SVG Structure Best Practices
- Include proper XML declaration: `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`
- Define reusable elements in `<defs>` section (gradients, filters, patterns)
- Use semantic IDs for all major elements (e.g., `id="leftSidebar"`, `id="topHeader"`)
- Group related elements using `<g>` tags with descriptive IDs
- Add layout guides for Figma with low opacity (opacity="0.1") for alignment

### Color and Styling
- Use hex color codes for consistency (#RRGGBB format)
- Define color palettes in README documentation
- Use gradients for backgrounds when appropriate
- Apply shadows/filters through SVG `<filter>` definitions

### File Organization
- Create corresponding README.md file for each mockup
- Include:
  - Description of the mockup
  - File structure
  - Usage instructions for Figma
  - Color palette
  - Dimensions and spacing
  - Typography guidelines
  - Component breakdown

## Error Prevention

### Before Saving SVG Files
1. Check all comments contain only ASCII characters
2. Validate XML syntax
3. Ensure all opening tags have closing tags
4. Verify all attribute values are properly quoted
5. Test file opens correctly in browser

### Common Issues to Avoid
- ❌ Non-ASCII characters in comments (causes XML parsing errors)
- ❌ Unclosed tags
- ❌ Unquoted attribute values
- ❌ Invalid XML entities
- ❌ Missing namespace declarations

## Prompt Generation Guidelines

When generating prompts for SVG mockup creation:

1. **Specify Structure**: Always request clear component breakdown (header, sidebar, main content, footer)
2. **Request Complete Element Coverage**: Emphasize that ALL elements must be included:
   - All navigation elements
   - All buttons and interactive elements
   - All icons (navigation, action, status, decorative)
   - All images and logos
   - All text content (no placeholders)
   - All form elements
   - All decorative elements
3. **Request Icon Handling**: Specify that all icons must be included and correctly positioned
4. **Request Accuracy**: Emphasize exact matching of colors, typography, spacing, and positioning
5. **Request Validation**: Ask for XML validation and browser testing
6. **Include Documentation**: Request README file with usage instructions, icon inventory, and image list
7. **Specify Encoding**: Emphasize ASCII-only comments
8. **Request Error Checking**: Ask to verify file opens in browser without errors
9. **Request Verification**: Ask to verify all elements match original page exactly

## Example Prompt Template

Create an SVG mockup for [PAGE_NAME] with:
- ASCII-only English comments in XML
- Proper XML structure with defs section
- Semantic element IDs for all major elements
- Layout guides for Figma
- ALL page elements included (navigation, buttons, forms, text, images, icons)
- ALL icons included and correctly positioned
- ALL images included and properly sized
- ALL text content matching original (no placeholders)
- Exact color matching using color picker values
- Exact typography matching (font family, size, weight, line height)
- Exact spacing and positioning matching original
- Corresponding README.md with:
  - Color palette with hex codes
  - Dimensions and spacing measurements
  - Complete component breakdown
  - Icon inventory and locations
  - Image list and sources
  - Typography guidelines
  - Usage instructions for Figma
- Validate XML syntax before completion
- Test that file opens in browser without errors
- Verify all elements match original page exactly

## Advanced SVG Features

### Gradients
- Define in `<defs>` section with unique IDs
- Use `linearGradient` for horizontal/vertical gradients
- Use `radialGradient` for circular/radial effects
- Reference gradients with `fill="url(#gradientId)"` or `stroke="url(#gradientId)"`

### Filters and Effects
- Create `<filter>` elements in `<defs>` section
- Common filters: shadows (`feGaussianBlur`, `feOffset`), glows
- Apply with `filter="url(#filterId)"` attribute

### Patterns
- Define `<pattern>` elements for repeating backgrounds
- Useful for grid patterns, textures
- Reference with `fill="url(#patternId)"`

## Figma Integration Details

### Import Process
1. **Direct SVG Import**: File → Import → Select SVG file
2. **Using Screenshot**: Import screenshot as reference, create vector elements on top
3. **Component Creation**: Break down SVG into reusable Figma components

### Component Structure for Figma
- Create Frame for each major section
- Use Auto Layout for flexible components
- Define Component variants for different states
- Set up Color Styles and Text Styles
- Configure Constraints for responsiveness

### Layout Guides
- Include in SVG with `opacity="0.1"` for visibility
- Use dashed lines: `stroke-dasharray="5,5"`
- Vertical guides for column boundaries
- Horizontal guides for section boundaries
- Can be hidden/removed after import to Figma

## README Documentation Template

Each mockup README should include:

1. **Description**: What page/interface is being mocked

## Browser Integration Workflow

### Getting Page Information
1. **Initial Setup**
   - Use browser snapshot tools to capture page structure
   - Take full-page screenshots for reference at original resolution
   - Save screenshots in `.playwright-mcp/` directory with descriptive names
   - Ensure page is fully loaded before capturing

2. **Comprehensive Page Analysis**
   - Identify main sections (header, sidebar, content, footer)
   - Note color schemes and gradients
   - Document typography and spacing
   - List all interactive elements
   - Capture all icons and their locations
   - Document all images and their sources
   - Extract all text content
   - Note all form elements and their states

3. **Element-by-Element Capture**
   - Use browser DevTools to inspect each element
   - Extract computed styles for each element
   - Capture element dimensions and positions
   - Document element hierarchy and nesting
   - Note any dynamic content or states

### Screenshot Naming Convention
- Format: `[page-name]-screenshot.png` or `[page-name]-reference.png`
- Store in `.playwright-mcp/` directory
- Reference screenshots in README documentation

## Comprehensive Page Analysis Process

### Step-by-Step Page Capture
1. **Initial Page Load**
   - Navigate to target page
   - Wait for all resources to load (images, fonts, scripts)
   - Scroll through entire page to trigger lazy-loaded content
   - Capture full-page screenshot for reference

2. **Element Inventory**
   - Create complete list of all visible elements:
     - Navigation menus and items
     - Buttons (all states: default, hover, active, disabled)
     - Form inputs (text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons)
     - Links and anchors
     - Headings (H1-H6)
     - Paragraphs and text blocks
     - Images and graphics
     - Icons (navigation, action, status, decorative)
     - Logos and branding elements
     - Badges, labels, tags
     - Cards and containers
     - Tables and data grids
     - Modals and overlays
     - Tooltips and popovers
     - Breadcrumbs
     - Pagination elements
     - Footer content

3. **Layout Analysis**
   - Document exact positioning of all elements
   - Measure spacing between elements (margins, padding)
   - Identify grid system and column structure
   - Note responsive breakpoints if visible
   - Capture z-index layering for overlapping elements

4. **Visual Details Capture**
   - Extract exact colors using color picker tool
   - Document all font families, sizes, weights, line heights
   - Measure border radius values
   - Capture shadow effects (offset, blur, color, spread)
   - Document gradient directions and color stops
   - Note opacity values for semi-transparent elements

## Icons and Images Handling

### Icon Extraction and Integration
1. **Icon Identification**
   - List all icons on the page (navigation, buttons, status indicators, decorative)
   - Document icon sizes and positions
   - Note icon colors and states (default, hover, active)
   - Identify icon libraries used (if detectable)

2. **Icon Representation in SVG**
   - **Option 1: Vector Paths**: Convert icons to SVG paths using `<path>` elements
   - **Option 2: Embedded SVG**: Include original SVG icons as `<svg>` elements within main SVG
   - **Option 3: Symbol References**: Define icons in `<defs>` section and reference with `<use>` elements
   - **Option 4: Base64 Encoding**: For complex icons, embed as base64-encoded data URIs
   - Always maintain original icon dimensions and aspect ratios
   - Preserve icon colors exactly as on original page

3. **Icon Organization**
   - Group related icons in `<g>` elements with semantic IDs (e.g., `id="navigationIcons"`)
   - Store icon definitions in `<defs>` section for reusability
   - Document all icons in README with descriptions and locations

### Image and Logo Handling
1. **Image Capture**
   - Extract all images from page (photos, illustrations, graphics)
   - Save original images separately in `.playwright-mcp/images/` directory
   - Document image dimensions, file formats, and file sizes

2. **Image Integration in SVG**
   - Embed images using `<image>` elements with `href` attribute
   - Use absolute or relative paths to image files
   - Alternative: Embed as base64-encoded data URIs for self-contained SVG
   - Maintain original aspect ratios
   - Preserve image positioning and sizing exactly

3. **Logo Treatment**
   - Capture logos at highest available resolution
   - Convert to SVG paths if possible for scalability
   - If raster format, ensure high DPI version is used
   - Document logo colors and any brand guidelines

## Text Content Capture

### Text Extraction Requirements
1. **Complete Text Inventory**
   - Extract ALL visible text from page (no placeholder text)
   - Include navigation labels, button text, headings, body copy
   - Capture tooltip text and alt text descriptions
   - Document form labels and placeholder text
   - Note any dynamic or generated text

2. **Text Styling Preservation**
   - Document exact font family for each text element
   - Capture font size, weight, line height, letter spacing
   - Preserve text colors and any text effects (shadows, gradients)
   - Note text alignment (left, center, right, justify)
   - Document text transforms (uppercase, lowercase, capitalize)

3. **Text in SVG**
   - Use `<text>` elements for all text content
   - Apply exact font styling using CSS or inline styles
   - Position text elements precisely to match original
   - Group related text in `<g>` elements
   - Use `<tspan>` for multi-line text blocks

2. **Replace all non-ASCII comments**: Convert to English ASCII-only comments
3. **Validate XML**: Use XML parser or browser to test
4. **PowerShell command for bulk fix** (if needed):

```powershell
$content = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllText('file.svg', [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8)
$lines = $content -split "`r?`n"
for ($i = 0; $i -lt $lines.Length; $i++) {
    if ($lines[$i] -match '<!--.*[^\x20-\x7E\x09].*-->') {
        $lines[$i] = $lines[$i] -replace '<!--.*[^\x20-\x7E\x09].*-->', '<!-- English comment -->'
    }
}
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText('mockup_file.svg', ($lines -join "`r`n"), [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8)
```
